# NN Tutorial

To run this tutorial, you need to have Python 3 installed, along with all the packages detailed in the requirements.txt, 
which can be installed by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This can be done either at a system level or using a virtual environment.

The tutorial has two runnable scripts: train and eval. Train uses the training data to train any of the 4 models and 
saves the results in a file, while eval receives an input consisting of an architecture definition and runs any of the 4
models over it to see if they are working properly.
